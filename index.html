      <h2>Intro</h2>

      <p>
        In 2022,  there were approximately 51 trillion microscopic pieces in the ocean weighing 269,000 tons. 
        That's as much as 1,345 blue whales. Technology says it's possible that humans may be consuming anywhere from 39,000 to 52,000 microplastic particles a year. 
        With added estimates of how much microplastic might be inhaled, that number is more than 74,000. 
        Microplastics will have a growing impact on our ecosystems, health, and economies if nothing is done.

        This is important for anyone living on this planet, but it’s especially crucial for the future generation and their parents. 
        Newborns and toddlers are particularly vulnerable to the dangers of microplastics as it affects development.

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Our campaign “PureBlue”, wants to convey the dangers of microplastics as they are out off by the public eye. 
            Here are some facts to get a deeper understanding of this small yet terrorizing danger…

            “…studies have reported significant detrimental effects on animal development and health, including intestinal defects, decreased body size, 
            decreased survival rate and reproduction, decreased motility, altered behavior, neurotoxicity, increased inflammation, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, 
            altered fat and energy metabolism, and changes in the microbiome.” - Article on <i>Frontiers</i>

            Plastic particles have been found in over a hundred animal species to date. 
            According to research, the largest sea creatures, such as the baleen whale, manta ray, and basking shark, are the most affected. 
            They all eat plankton and thus consume massive amounts of microplastics. Toxic additives such as plasticizers are added to this. 
            These have a similar effect to hormones and reduce fertility. In extreme cases, they can even cause male animals to develop ovaries.

            “Most clothes we wear today are made out of synthetic materials. 
            Every time a piece of clothing is washed, it releases 1,900 plastic microfibers into the water…
            The plastic industry releases an estimated 53 billion nurdles annually in the UK – that’s the same amount it would take to make 88 million plastic bottles.
